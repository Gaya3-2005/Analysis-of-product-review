#Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

Introduction
This project performs sentiment analysis on product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on their text content. This can help businesses understand customer feedback and improve their products accordingly.

Features
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
Sentiment classification using machine learning and deep learning models
Visualization of sentiment distribution
Support for multiple datasets

Technologies Used
Python
NLTK for NLP
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Pandas & NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib for data visualization

Dataset
The dataset consists of product reviews collected from e-commerce platforms. It includes review text along with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). A sample dataset is provided in the data directory

Usage
Prepare the dataset by placing it in the data/ directory.
Run the preprocessing script
Train the sentiment analysis model
Evaluate the model on test data
Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new reviews

Results
The project provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate model performance. Visualization of results is available in the results directory
